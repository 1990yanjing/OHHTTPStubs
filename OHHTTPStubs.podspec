                    |
                    | * Test your apps with fake network data (stubbed from file)
                    | * Use customized stubs depending on the requests
                    | * Use custom response time to simulate slow network.
                    | * This works with any request (HTTP, HTTPS, or any protocol) sent using
                    |   the iOS URL Loading System (NSURLConnection, NSURLSession, AFNetworking, â€¦)
